// An obvious thing to do next is create event listeners to list for `cmd z`
// and `cmd y` to do undo and redo for you. The only problem is that we don't
// have lifecycle methods. One solution would be to create a React component
// and use document.addEventListener on componentWillMount and also use
// document.removeEventListener on componentWillUnmount. This would work, but
// it introduces side-effects to our user-interface. It doesn't seem like a big
// deal right now (and in this case is isn't), but once we start dealing with
// HTTP requests, you'll see why it helps to offload side-effects to services.
// For now, this is just a gentle introduction to declaring side-effects other
// than rendering HTML.

// pretty much everything is the same as before except a few things:

// Lets review how this works in a little more detail. `declare` returns an
// object of declarative data-structures with bound callbacks for async actions.
// When we map over the the state$ to get the effects$, we call each service
// with the effects$. The service will the read a specific property of the
// effects object and perform whatever side-effects necessary.
//
// It is also important to understand why the hotkeys are specified in an array
// as opposed to just a plain old object. Any services that aren't going to be
// composed later on ought to be wrapped up in an array so they can be
// concatenated. This way, in our higher-order components, we can simply concatenate
// all services other than the HTML service and we now have a generic listOf
// component regardless of what services its children use. Check out how the
// more generic listOf function works:

// start(undoable(listOf(counter)), [render, hotkeys])

// and notice how this version is fundamentally different because `cmd z` will
// undo all counters at the same time.

// start(listOf(undoable(counter)), [render, hotkeys])
