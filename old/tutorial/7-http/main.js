// produce any compiled CSS, otherwise, you'll have lots of repetative CSS.

// A few things to notice here:
// Rather than return a Promise or a Future or some other side-effect, we're
// return a declarative data structure that says what we want. Note that if
// other user interface actions were going one while the the HTTP request is
// in flight, we still return an object saying, "hey, I still need this.".
//
// Just like React does virtual DOM diffing to do the minimum amount of DOM
// mutation, the fetch service diffs the requests with any requests that are
// currently in-flight so we're not sending multiple requests when we don't
// need to. We perform this diff based on the key property of the http request
// object.
//
// The fetch service is based on the ES6 window.fetch API. The url property
// becomes the first argument to window.fetch and all other properties other
// than key, onSuccess, and onError are passed as the second argument to
// window.fetch.
//
// https://github.com/github/fetch
//
// Anyways, try it out:

// start(app, [render, fetch])

// The power we gain from declaratively data fetching is the same as we gained
// from using a virtual DOM like React. We no longer have to worry about all
// the imperative side-effects going on and gain more control over our
// application.
//
// One particlarly powerful demonstration of this is time-travel. When you're
// application spawns side-effects from within the lifecycle of the component
// you end up spamming your external services when you do time-travel (like
// with Redux and the thunk middleware) and if you block those side-effects,
// then you cannot gracefully recover when you press play from the state of a
// pending request.
//
// Check out this example with the time-travelling debugger. Use `ctrl d` to
// toggle the debug panel. And try pressing play from a state where the request
// is pending. Now hopefully you can really appreciate the abstraction power
// we have harnessed by diligently writing pure, side-effect free code. :)

start(debug(app), [render, fetch, hotkeys])

// A couple things to note about using the debugger with this example:
// - Chrome will not cache the images if you have the Dev Tools open, so the
// images will have to reload as you slide. But close the Dev Tools and it
// will work more like you expect.
// - Giphy will return a random gif every time you send a request, so when you
// press play from a pending state, you'll likely get a different gif from
// before. Another way to say this is the random giphy API is not idempotent.
