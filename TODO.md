# TODO

tutorial

- laziness + performance
  - Lazy react component
  - special dispatch and callback function helpers

- children with combinators
  - wiring everything up
  - unknown services when building the component

- other side-effects
  - http requests (get the weather or something)
    - diff the entire tree of http requests directly just like react does
  - lru cache component
  - hotkeys
    - reduce the entire tree and batch dispatch
  - graphql?

- children tree because we dont know all side-effects beforehand, describe as data
  - dynamic children

- performance of other side-effects
